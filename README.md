- 👋 Hi, I’m @mcdeleve, brazilian rapper, song writing and composer for about 20 years and that have been in the tech and even before the music. But with my kknowledge of Napster at that time (2000's) we were the first brazilian independent/original rap group that was on Napster. At that time, all that you had was original CDs ripped of to the Napster, not original and unreleased songs. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Open Source Software and Linux stuff. I use to do my songs only and exclusively in Open Source SOftware in the Linux environment. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Bash Scripting. I have some simple scripts that i want to share with the community. I use to do some cloud testing in AWS and icecast online radio, with the good help from a friend, and it worked well! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone who are enthusiasts in open source projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me ramondeleve@gmail.com.
